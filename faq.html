              <p>
                I offer a wide range of services related to application
                development and web design. My portfolio includes web and mobile
                application designs, as well as graphic designs and user
                interfaces. Additionally, there is a blog on my website where I
                share my life, passions and experience related to studies.

              <p>
                The cooperation process begins with the first contact, followed
                by the signing of the contract. Then we define the scope of work
                and conduct a conversation to agree on the details of the
                project. Thanks to this, the process is transparent and tailored
                to the individual needs of the client.

              <p>
                I specialize in creating applications using technologies such as
                React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, PHP, Laravel, as well as in
                working with MySQL (Oracle) databases and the GitHub code
                management tool.

              <p>
                Prices for my services are determined individually, depending on
                the scope and complexity of the project. I always strive to
                ensure that my services are competitive and tailored to the
                client's budget.

              <p>
                The project implementation time depends on its scope and
                requirements. Each project is different, so the completion date
                is agreed individually with the client.

              <p>
                Yes, I offer a guarantee of a well-executed project and support
                after its completion. I make sure that my clients are fully
                satisfied with the final product.

            </summary>
            <div>
              <img src="src/assets/img/Faq/Faq7.webp" />
              <p>
                My design philosophy is based on creating solutions that not
                only look aesthetic, but are, above all, functional and tailored
                to the needs of users. I believe that good design combines
                clarity, usability and innovation.

              <p>
                What information do you need from the client to get started? To
                get started, I need an initial design brief from the client that
                includes the project goal, target audience, style and
                functionality preferences, as well as any other information that
                may be relevant to the project.

                What are your favorite projects in your portfolio and why? My
                favorite projects are those that challenged me and allowed me to
                develop new skills. I value projects in which I could experiment
                with new technologies and solutions, which brought satisfaction
                to both me and my clients.

              <p>
                What hobbies or interests do you have outside of design and
                programming? My passions outside the IT world are acting on the
                Internet. When I was a kid, I ran a YouTube channel, recording
                games on it. I am active on Instagram and Tiktok. I have many
                interests.
